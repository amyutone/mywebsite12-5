Tatte's new Foggy Bottom location, which arrived in July, now joins Peet's, Starbucks and Panera as a major source of caffeine on campus.

The Foggy Bottom area is swiftly changing with development projects ushering in new space for businesses big and small -- including a host of new flavors to the nearby dining scene.

Since the conclusion of the school year in May, several new restaurants have opened in the Foggy Bottom area. It can be easy to revert back to old-favorites for meals around campus, especially when schoolwork picks up, but don't forget to try these recent additions to the neighborhood.\

Tatte Bakery & Cafe**\
It's official: there's a new [Tatte](https://tattebakery.com/) location in Foggy Bottom to satisfy all your pastry and coffee needs. Tatte, a somewhat new chain that originated in Boston, has joined Starbucks, Peet's Coffee and Panera as one of the top sources of caffeine on campus for students this year.

Tatte [unveiled](https://www.gwhatchet.com/2022/07/13/tatte-bakery-and-cafe-opens-foggy-bottom-location/) its Foggy Bottom location at 2129 I Street NW, the brand-new glass office complex across the street from Lafayette Hall, in July. The bakery opens from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. from Monday to Saturday and from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sunday. Tatte offers pastries, breads and coffee, all of which are listed on the Tatte All Day [Menu](https://tattebakery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DC_Summer2022_allday_060122.v2.pdf). The new Foggy Bottom location features a coffee bar with an all matte-finish, wooden tables and a large patio with green plants.

Tatte works with [Toast Takeout](https://www.toasttab.com/tatte-bakery-cafe-foggy-bottom/v3/?mode=fulfillment), a cloud-based restaurant software company, offering customers online ordering and pickup. Most popular dishes include their iced latte, breakfast sandwich (\$9.75) -- made with eggs, Vermont cheddar, applewood smoked bacon and homemade sourdough -- and Turkey B.L.A.T. (\$11.75), a turkey sandwich with bacon, lettuce and avocado topped with sriracha aioli and a tomato-onion relish.

**Tigerella**\
Another bakery-focused Italian coffee shop named [Tigerella](https://www.tigerelladc.com/) provides a distinctive coffee ordering and dine-in experience by splitting its business into two sections, where one portion of the shop offers grab-and-go options for coffee and lunch, and the other side dedicates itself to full service to customers.

Located in Western Market, the business [opened](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cgjud1gOqmz/) in July and provides grab-and-go breakfast and lunch from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. and full-service lunch 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. during weekdays. Tigerella will [open](https://www.tigerelladc.com/) their dinner service in September.

Tigerella features espresso, pastries like croissants (\$4.5) and scones (\$3.5), and Italian-style pizzas (\$7). Their grab-and-go lunch options include salads and a muffuletta sandwich (\$12) -- a dish originating from New Orleans made with Italian bread, cold cuts and olive salad. The all-day menu offers mouth-watering thin crust pizza slices (\$7) with cheese cooked to the ideal shade of golden brown.

**Bandoola Bowl**\
[Bandoola Bowl](https://bandoolabowl.com/), a Southeast Asian salad shop that became another summer addition to Western Market, offers a variety of customizable bowls and salads with fruits and protein including mango, papaya and pork.

The founders are Burmese natives who [sought](https://bandoolabowl.com/bandoola-bowl-dc/about/) to introduce D.C. to the fresh and bright Burmese cuisine. Salads play an integral role in the food culture of the country, often starting with a base of thinly sliced cabbage or similar vegetables compared to the more traditional leafy greens.

In addition to a variety of salads, the restaurant also offers warm bowls with a rice or noodle base. Shweji (\$4), a traditional Burmese semolina cake, is a pudding-like dessert made from coconut milk and raisins. Bandoola Bowl is an ideal spot for those with dietary restrictions, including ingredients bursting with plenty of protein, like soft boiled eggs and tofu, in addition to nut-free options for those with allergies.

This is an efficient spot for a grab-and-go meal between classes, helping you fit some vegetables into your diet.

**Boogy & Peel**\
Just a short walk away from campus in Dupont Circle, pizzeria [Boogy & Peel](https://www.boogyandpeel.com/menus/) opened its doors after the end of the school year in May.

The pizza spot is known for their creative takes on classic [pizzas](https://dc.eater.com/2022/5/20/23125401/boogy-and-peel-pizza-opens-dupont-circle), like a Big Mac pizza (\$22), which incorporates beef, American cheese, iceberg lettuce, onions, pickles and "special sauce." The 13-inch pizzas' intriguing flavors include a Taco Bell Mexican pizza called This is Beans (\$22) and a deli-like cold cut pie (\$23).

Visitors can enjoy their pizza alongside a strawberry-guava hard seltzer (\$4) or a Bell's Oberon (\$5), a light ale that will cool you down during a hot summer night in the District. Boogy & Peel also serves one dessert option -- a chocolate soft serve (\$7) classified as a "stoner's delight," topped with peanuts, pretzels and potatoes chips. Sides include wings dressed in Alabama barbecue sauce (\$13) and selection of salads (\$11) with hearty ingredients like farro, smoked pecans and feta.

The spot is worth making a trip for a sit-down lunch with a friend between classes or an end-of-the-week dinner treat.
